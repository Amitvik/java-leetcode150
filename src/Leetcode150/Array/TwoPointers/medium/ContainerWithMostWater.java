/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.



Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

public class ContainerWithMostWater {
    public static int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = height.length-1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (j > i) {
            int area = Math.min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
            if (height[i] < height[j])
                i++;
            else
                j--;

        }
        return maxArea;

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(maxArea(new int[]{1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7}));
        System.out.println(maxArea(new int[]{1, 1}));
    }
